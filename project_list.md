## Possible Projects for CS1980/CS1640/BIOSC1640 Students

Please email me your top THREE choices by Wednesday (6 Sep) morning at 11:59 AM (i.e., right before noon).  Please list them in the order that you prefer them.  You will be informed as to your project during the next Capstone class on Friday 8 Sep.  If you do not email me by then, I will assume you do not care which project you are on and I will place uncommitted students on whichever projects still need people.

Along with your selections, please include any qualifications or specific reasons for interest that you have for those specific projects.   Remember that you are "interviewing" for the project against others, especially if you have selected popular projects.   Students who respond early also show enthusiasm for the projects, which goes a long way to showing that they actually want to do them.

I will attempt to place you in one of your top three choices.  Last semester, every student got into one of their top three (and a majority into their #1 choice), although I do not make any guarantees.

### Industry Projects

These are projects where you will be working directly with a company.  Note - if you end up on an Industry project, your course registration will change to CS1981.  This is an administrative detail and will have no impact on you other than a slightly different number appearing on your transcript.

_NetApp_: (POC: Chuck Heinle)

_Viz_: PROJECT "RUMOR MILL" - One type of analytics that is useful, but not often employed is a simulation.  The project would be to create a prototype agent-based simulation system for the analysis of "flow" through a network.  The prototype can be a social network and the flow can be how gossip is spread.  This type of simulation can be extended for other networks (disease, computer virus, zombie attack!) and other flows.  The system would load a network of entities and relationships (as GraphML or a set of CSV input files), allow the user to specify simulation parameters including how data is transmitted from one entity to another, and then launch a simulation run, and then provide the data in a manner such that the user can do subsequent analysis and visualization. (POC: Dr. Mike Bigrigg)

_Yelp_: TBD (POC: Dean Thompson)

### Faculty Projects

These are projects working with academic faculty, either at the University of Pittsburgh or elsewhere.

_Sterile Compound Training in Augmented/Virtual Reality_: An augmented/virtual reality game for Pharmacy students to learn how to deal with sterile compounding.  This is an existing project, and so students will add additional functionality. (POC: Dr. Ravi Patel, University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy)

_Pharmacy Quiz Game_: A currently existing application, this is an extendible web-based quiz game for Pharmacy students.  Students would work on adding additional functionality. (POC: Dr. Ravi Patel, University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy)

_Sweden project?_

### Open-Source Non-Faculty

_Triplett project?_

### Bioinformatics-Focused

These projects have a focus on bioinformatics specifically.  Preference is given to BIOSC1640 or CS1640-registered students, or those with a background in bioinformatics or a related discipline.  However, this does not mean that if you are not a Bioinformatics student, that you are prevented from signing up for one of these projects!

_Online IBD Assessment Tool_ - We would like to develop a personalized online assessment tool and application regarding preventive care recommendations for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Our goal would be to create an assessment based on a few simple questions: age, immunosuppression use and type, and risk factors for meningococcal (military, college students). After answering these questions, it would lead to the generation of an automated form, the ‘IBD Preventive Passport’, which would serve as a comprehensive preventive tool, including recommendations for immunizations, labs that should be monitored while on certain types of immunosuppression, and osteoporosis and cancer screening. It would be ideal to be able to view the output on the application as well as printed out to allow for easier review with the primary gastroenterology provider and then shared between providers.

_UPMC Geriatrics_: (POC: Dr. Rollin Wright)

_Google Cardboard for 3Dmol.js_ Implement support for device motion control of a 3D view of a molecular model within a web browser using JavaScript.  1-2 students. http://3dmol.csb.pitt.edu/ (POC: David Koes)

_Durrant project?_
